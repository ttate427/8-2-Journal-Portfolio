The Gaming Room is a company that developed an Android game called Draw It or Lose It, where players guess drawings to earn points. They tasked us with designing a multi-platform version of their game that could run seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and web browsers. I believe I did particularly well in developing clear and organized documentation, especially when outlining the system architecture and user requirements. Working through the design document helped me tremendously by giving structure to the coding phase; it allowed me to anticipate potential challenges before writing any code.
If I could revise one part of the documentation, I would strengthen the risk assessment section by detailing more specific mitigation strategies. Understanding and implementing user needs was a big focus â€” I ensured the design prioritized cross-platform compatibility, simple interfaces, and consistent user experiences across devices. Considering user needs is crucial because it directly impacts how well the software serves its intended audience. My approach to designing the software was to use a modular strategy, breaking down the game into smaller components and creating diagrams to visualize workflows. In future projects, I would continue using modular design but would also add user journey mapping earlier to better tailor the software to how users naturally interact with it.
