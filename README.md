Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? The Gaming Room is a company that created an Android game called Draw It or Lose It, where players guess drawings to score points. They wanted us to design a version of the game that could run across multiple platforms, like Windows, macOS, and web browsers.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? I clearly outlined the system architecture, user requirements, and platform considerations, making it easy to transition from documentation to coding.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? Creating the design document helped organize my thoughts and anticipate potential challenges early, which made the development process smoother and more efficient.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? I would revise the risk assessment section to include more detailed mitigation strategies. Being more specific would strengthen the project’s long-term planning.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on cross-platform functionality, ease of use, and ensuring consistent game behavior on all devices. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures the final product is practical, enjoyable, and accessible to the intended audience.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? I approached the design by breaking the system into smaller components (modular design), identifying core functionalities, and using diagrams to visualize workflows. In the future, I would continue using modular design but also implement user journey mapping earlier in the process to better predict how users interact with the app.
